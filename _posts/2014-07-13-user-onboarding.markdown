description: <p>It doesn't matter what your product is, user onboarding is <strong>absolutely critical</strong> for the retention of your users.</p> <p>Get it right, and people will use your product as a shining example of how to do product onboarding. Users will start their journey (relationship) with your product in a positive light, and will almost certainly give your product a longer chance to prove its value.</p> <p>Get it wrong however, and in the best case you'll leave users with a bitter taste in their mouths and a poor first contact with your product. In the worst case, your user won't even complete the onboarding and you'll lose them before you even get a chance to show them how great your product is.</p><p>We'll assess your onboarding journey from that first download or registration, through to how you educate users on the features of your product or app. There's one key advantage here - we haven't seen your product yet...</p>
